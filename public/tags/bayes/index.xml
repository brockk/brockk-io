      <title>PePS2</title>
      <link>https://www.kristianbrock.com/project/peps2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PePS2 is a phase II trial of pembrolizumab in performance status 2 (PS2) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
It is run by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/mds/trials/crctu/&#34;&gt;Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PePS2 is an important trial to me because I developed the analysis model as part of my PhD thesis and worked on the trial from almost the very beginning.
I published a trial design paper and am glad to say that the trial results are currently under peer review.
The investigators and I hope this trial will provide much-needed and much-sought evidence on the merits of giving this PD-L1 blockade drug to PS2 NSCLC patients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became involved in PePS2 shortly after joining the trials unit in 2014.
The trial called for a design that evaluated co-primary response and toxicity outcomes.
Naturally, this suggests a Bryant &amp;amp; Day optimal design.
However, published data in performance status 0 &amp;amp; 1 NSCLC patients showed that the PD-L1 tumour proportion score biomarker was strongly predictive of response.
There was also evidence that first-line patients did better than subsequent-line patients.
We expected each of these variables to remain predictive in the performance status 2 population and wanted to stratify the analysis by these variables.
Unfortunately, Bryant &amp;amp; Day&#39;s design assumes an homogeneous population so does not admit explanatory variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I happened to be working on a dose-finding trial at the time that used the EffTox design of Thall &amp;amp; Cook (2004) to appraise joint efficacy and toxicity rates at different doses of experimental agents.
It struck me on a cycle home that the EffTox design could be adjusted with variables reflecting PD-L1 and line-of-therapy status in place of dose to study our co-primary outcomes whilst adjusting for our putative predictive factors.
I worked up the design as part of my PhD, eventually published a design paper, and used the model to conduct a Bayesian analysis of the outcomes in a results manuscript that is currently in peer-review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;trialr&lt;/code&gt; is an R package that implements Bayesian clinical trial design in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mc-stan.org/&#34;&gt;Stan&lt;/a&gt;, a modern enviroment for probabilistic programming that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling.
Bayesian models are relatively abundant in early phase clinical trials where information is scarce and sensible inference is required practically from the moment the trial begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;trialr&lt;/code&gt; implements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Contimual Reassessment Method (CMR) for toxicity-based dose-finding;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time-to-event CRM for late-onset toxicity in dose-finding;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the EffTox for toxicity- and efficacy-based dose-finding;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wason &amp;amp; Seaman&#39;s Augmented Binary method for fusing continuous and binary outcomes in phase II;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a hierarchical model of binary responses on related subgroups;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;trialr is available on CRAN and is listed on my GitHub page.
There is a manuscript currently under peer-review (pre-print linked below) and it has been used to analyse outcomes in a forthcoming set of clinical trial results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Phase II Clinical Trial Design for Associated Co-primary Efficacy and Toxicity Outcomes with Baseline Covariates</title>
      <link>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/peps2-design/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-this-publication&#34;&gt;About this publication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting this paper published was a big deal for me because it was the first design idea I had had that was completely my own.
Well, so I thought.
An erudite peer-reviewer pointed out that the method (which I had named Bayesian Evaluation of Bivariate Outcomes and Predictive variables, or BEBOP) was actually a special case of a design by Thall, Nguyen &amp;amp; Estey.
In response, I re-wrote the paper presenting the design as a novel refinement of their method suitable for phase II trials, called P2TNE for &lt;em&gt;Phase II Thall Nguyen &amp;amp; Estey&lt;/em&gt;.
Anyway, after being rejected twice from big journals, it was a big relief to get the paper published in the BAYSM2018 conference proceedings.
It was especially classy of Springer to give a complementary hard cover copy of the book to each contributing author.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>trialr - Bayesian Clinical Trial Designs in R and Stan</title>
      <link>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/trialr/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/trialr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-this-publication&#34;&gt;About this publication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of Stan whilst working on some Bayesian clinical trial designs.
I recall using Monte Carlo integration to resolve six-dimensional integrals to estimate posterior means and thinking that there must be a better way.
In fact, there were probably many better ways.
However, I doubt any would be as good as Stan, a probabilistic programming language and Hamiltonion Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler.
This manuscript is my first sole-author attempt at research.
It was particularly pleasing to implement James Wason and Shaun Seaman&#39;s augmented binary method, an approach that will surely feature strongly if we are to wean ourselves off information-light binary response variables.
&lt;code&gt;trial&lt;/code&gt; is on CRAN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to design a dose-finding study using the continual reassessment method</title>
      <link>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/crm-tutorial/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/crm-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-this-publication&#34;&gt;About this publication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been a trial statistician about 6 months when I attended an NIHR workshop on early phase trial methodology in 2014.
The topic of the day was the trials community&#39;s over-reliance on rule-based dose-finding methods like 3+3.
This tutorial paper was produced by a group of attendees to promote model-based methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combination Lenalidomide and Azacitidine - A Novel Salvage Therapy in Patients Who Relapse After Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
      <link>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/viola-results/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/viola-results/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-this-publication&#34;&gt;About this publication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper is important to me because Viola was the first dose-finding trial that I worked on.
It uses a CRM model to identify a dose of lenalidomide that is tolerable when given with azacitidine to AML and MDS patients.
This was also one of my first published sets of trial results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementing the EffTox dose-finding design in the Matchpoint trial</title>
      <link>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/matchpoint-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/matchpoint-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-this-publication&#34;&gt;About this publication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first first-author publication and a chapter in my PhD thesis.
Working with EffTox was great, but challenging at times.
The seamless phase I/II approach to dose-finding, where efficacy and toxicity outcomes guide dose selection, has never been more important in this era of targeted therapies in oncology.
However, the EffTox design and the suite of phase I/II methods in general have been relatively underutilised.
We hope this paper demonstrating our experiences with EffTox will inspire early phase trialists to look further than the 3+3.&lt;/p&gt;
