      <title>Ibrutinib Plus Venetoclax in Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia - The CLARITY Study</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This publication is important to me because Clarity was my first successful grant application.
It is a simple trial with modest sample size but the results are absolutely amazing, with an iwCLL response rate of 89% and minimum disease negative status achieved in the peripheral blood of 53% of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to design a dose-finding study using the continual reassessment method</title>
      <link>https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/crm-tutorial/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been a trial statistician about 6 months when I attended an NIHR workshop on early phase trial methodology in 2014.
The topic of the day was the trials community&#39;s over-reliance on rule-based dose-finding methods like 3+3.
This tutorial paper was produced by a group of attendees to promote model-based methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combination Lenalidomide and Azacitidine - A Novel Salvage Therapy in Patients Who Relapse After Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This publication is important to me because Viola was the first dose-finding trial that I worked on.
It uses a CRM model to identify a dose of lenalidomide that is tolerable when given with azacitidine to AML and MDS patients.
This was also one of my first published sets of trial results.&lt;/p&gt;
