      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-this-publication&#34;&gt;About this publication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting this paper published was a big deal for me because it was the first design idea I had had that was completely my own.
Well, so I thought.
An erudite peer-reviewer pointed out that the method (which I had named Bayesian Evaluation of Bivariate Outcomes and Predictive variables, or BEBOP) was actually a special case of a design by Thall, Nguyen &amp;amp; Estey.
In response, I re-wrote the paper presenting the design as a novel refinement of their method suitable for phase II trials, called P2TNE for &lt;em&gt;Phase II Thall Nguyen &amp;amp; Estey&lt;/em&gt;.
Anyway, after being rejected twice from big journals, it was a big relief to get the paper published in the BAYSM2018 conference proceedings.
It was especially classy of Springer to give a complementary hard cover copy of the book to each contributing author.&lt;/p&gt;
