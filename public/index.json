The module is a core part of the university's new MSc in Clinical Trials. It runs over five consecutive days from 9th to 13th March 2020.\nDay One Day one is concerned with dose-finding trials. We learn about the fundamentals of dose-finding and the perennial yet underwhelming 3+3 method. We will perform hands-on analysis using R, RStudio and Shiny web apps to simulate virtual trials and observe how the 3+3 method comes unstuck. We also delve into some of the historic disasters that have occurred in dose-finding trials and look at features in the design and conduct that can ameliorate the dangers.\nDay Two Day two builds on the material from day one by introducing model-based dose-finding methods. We focus in particular on the continual reassessment method (CRM). We learn about model fitting and interpretation, and see the method in action in practical sessions. We then look at how model-based dose-finding trials are reported in journals. We finish the day by hearing testimony from a patient on a dose-finding trial at CRCTU.\nDay Three On day three we leave dose-finding behind and turn our focus to phase II trials. On this day we learn about the different approaches to phase II trials, including the suite of optimal designs with fixed sample size, like A'Hern's, Simon's two-stage, and Bryant \u0026amp; Day's designs. We conclude with an interview of a patient from the Clarity trial at CRCTU.\nDay Four On day four, we cover advanced topics at phase II. This includes the use of surrogate outcomes when it is impossible to observe the clinical outcome of primary interest in a reasonable time frame. We also look at co-primary outcomes, and the roles of biomarkers and subgroups.\nDay Five Day five is a special day devoted to Complex and Innovative Designs, a group that includes basket trials, umbrella trials, and platform trials. These designs have proliferated in cancer in recent years as we have discovered many potential driver mutations, allowing trialists to investigate therapies that target specific genetic aberrations. We study examples run by the University of Birmingham's two trials units. We then look at these designs from the point of view of a competent authority, like the MHRA, the EMA or the FDA.\nTo learn more, visit the course webpage at https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/taught/med/pg-modules/early-phase-clinical-trials.aspx.\n","date":1577491200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1577611673,"objectID":"c8e361319c51b2ed52aeb7c6cab606d9","permalink":"https://www.kristianbrock.com/courses/epct/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/epct/","section":"courses","summary":"TODO","tags":null,"title":"Early Phase Clinical Trials","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

I found I would frequently get the designs mixed up:\n \u0026ldquo;We are targeting 20% toxicity in this trial, right? No, that was the other trial\u0026hellip;we are targeting 33% here\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n Similarly, once or twice, I got to the stage where I wanted to run simulations only to discover we had not specified some important design aspect, like when the trial should stop. To bring all the pertinent information to the fore, I wrote a checklist. I would take the list and fill it out for each trial to ensure I had all the right information before I started simulating.\nDownload the checklist as PDF, editable Word version, or completed example.\nChecklist 1. Doses under investigation? Put simply, which doses are you investigating? And how many are there? Let's refer to the number of doses as $n$. For the plain vanilla CRM, the doses should be fully orderable, meaning it should be possible to unambiguously state that $a \u0026gt; b$ or $a \u0026lt; b$ for each pair of doses $a, b$. Incidentally, this is also true of the 3+3. It is easy to inadvertently violate the total orderability rule when you have combinations (e.g. is 10mg A + 10mb B a greater or lesser dose than 5mg A + 20mg B?) or when you are varying doses and frequencies (e.g. is 20mg of A each day a greater or lesser dose than 100mg of A once per week?).\n2. Target toxicity level? What probability of dose-limiting toxicity are you targeting? CRM and 3+3 are toxicity-chasing designs - they will escalate dose until toxicity is seen. There must be a rationale for why escalation is anticipated to be beneficial to the patient. So what probability of toxicity are you targeting? If it is hard to specify an acceptable target, or the target is very low, that might be a sign that CRM and 3+3 are not suitable approaches.\n3. Skeleton? What is your a-priori expectation of the rate of toxicity at each dose? This should be a monotonically-increasing vector of probabilities of length $n$.\n4. Starting dose? Which dose will you start at? Having a dose or two to de-escalate to might be preferable in case your toxicity expectations are wrong.\n5. Model type? There have been various suggestions to model the dose-toxicity curve. Will you use the empiric approach, or a one parameter logisitic approach, etc?\n6. Model parameters? Different model types require different parameters and hyperparameters. E.g. the empiric model shifts the skeleton up and down as DLT outcomes are evaluated in patients, using a single parameter, often called $\\beta$. That parameter needs a prior distribution. The default prior on $\\beta$ in dfcrm is $\\beta \\sim N(0, 1.34)$. I will let you research why.\n7. How to select dose? Will you select the dose with estimated DLT probability closest to the target? Or closest to target without exceeding the target? Will you permit skipping doses in escalation? How about de-escalation?\n8. When to stop? Trials end1 - when will your trial end? What is the maximum sample size? Do you have a stopping rule for excess toxicity? Do you want to evaluate a minimum number of patients at the candidate dose before you stop? Also, check that these constraints do not contradict one another!\n9. Length of DLT assessment window? How long is the DLT assessment window?\nIf using non-time-to-event method: 10. How to select cohort size? Commonly, designs have used fixed cohort sizes of three. But perhaps you want to use flexible cohort sizes of 2-5 patients, depending on the times at which the patients arrive? How will you simulate this?\nIf using time-to-event method: 11. How to calculate weight of observation? Under the Time-to-Event CRM (TITE-CRM), censored observations of non-DLT are weighted somewhere between 0 and 1. Logically, the weight should be a non-decreasing function of the length of follow-up. If DLT is experienced, the weight should be 1. Several weight functions have been proposed. A simple option is linear, i.e. 50% of the evaluation period without DLT is considered to be 0.5 non-DLT events.\nFor simulation: 12. What is assumed true Prob(DLT)? The key simulation parameter, what is the true probability of DLT at each dose? It will be tempting to choose a true dose-DLT curve that looks similar to your skeleton but do not stop there. Naturally, a thorough simulation study will look at many true dose-DLT curves, with the sought dose appearing at different positions. If you have a rule for early stopping, you might want to consider a scenario where the true DLT probabilities are all too high.\nFor simulation using time-to-event method: 13. What is time between patient arrivals? When simulating using the TITE-CRM method, you will need to randomly sample patient arrival times. For memoryless waiting times, the exponential distribution would do the job.\n14. What is time between patient arrivals? Generally in simulation, you sample whether toxicity will happen in a patient given their assigned dose and the associated probability of DLT using a random draw from a Bernoulli distribution. Once you have established that toxicity occurs in a given patient, you will need to sample the time of the DLT. How will you do that? You might assume a constant hazard, for example, and thus use an exponential distribution. Obviously, if a patient does not experience DLT then their DLT time is infinite.\nAvailability of software Having made all these choices (and it is exhausting to even think of all these things), you then have to find or write code to make it happen. You may find you do not have the time or programming skill to write exactly what you want and opt for an off-the-shelf solution. Each of dfcrm, bcrm, and crmPack offer methods for simulating CRM trials, and my very own trialr will have CRM simulation methods soon. However, each differs in what they offer (that feels like a blog post for another day). You may discover that no off-the-shelf package does exactly what you want and find yourself tweaking your choices above in light of what is feasible. It is an iterative process.\nRead more Graham Wheeler and co-authors 2 wrote a tutorial for designing dose-finding trials using the CRM.

It is run by the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit.\nPePS2 is an important trial to me because I developed the analysis model as part of my PhD thesis and worked on the trial from almost the very beginning. I published a trial design paper and am glad to say that the trial results are currently under peer review. The investigators and I hope this trial will provide much-needed and much-sought evidence on the merits of giving this PD-L1 blockade drug to PS2 NSCLC patients\nDesign I became involved in PePS2 shortly after joining the trials unit in 2014. The trial called for a design that evaluated co-primary response and toxicity outcomes. Naturally, this suggests a Bryant \u0026amp; Day optimal design. However, published data in performance status 0 \u0026amp; 1 NSCLC patients showed that the PD-L1 tumour proportion score biomarker was strongly predictive of response. There was also evidence that first-line patients did better than subsequent-line patients. We expected each of these variables to remain predictive in the performance status 2 population and wanted to stratify the analysis by these variables. Unfortunately, Bryant \u0026amp; Day's design assumes an homogeneous population so does not admit explanatory variables.\nI happened to be working on a dose-finding trial at the time that used the EffTox design of Thall \u0026amp; Cook (2004) to appraise joint efficacy and toxicity rates at different doses of experimental agents. It struck me on a cycle home that the EffTox design could be adjusted with variables reflecting PD-L1 and line-of-therapy status in place of dose to study our co-primary outcomes whilst adjusting for our putative predictive factors. I worked up the design as part of my PhD, eventually published a design paper, and used the model to conduct a Bayesian analysis of the outcomes in a results manuscript that is currently in peer-review.\n","date":1577404800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578603720,"objectID":"972223b45ad93e77c340a6766126073b","permalink":"https://www.kristianbrock.com/project/peps2/","publishdate":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/peps2/","section":"project","summary":"PePS2 is a phase II trial of pembrolizumab in performance status 2 non-small-cell lung cancer patients.","tags":["Bayes","PhaseII"],"title":"PePS2","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"trialr is an R package that implements Bayesian clinical trial design in Stan, a modern enviroment for probabilistic programming that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling.

We hope this paper demonstrating our experiences with EffTox will inspire early phase trialists to look further than the 3+3.\n","date":1500508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578603720,"objectID":"3ed4857002ffa139b320f3d42e1cdb85","permalink":"https://www.kristianbrock.com/publication/matchpoint-design/","publishdate":"2017-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/matchpoint-design/","section":"publication","summary":"The Matchpoint trial aims to identify the optimal dose of ponatinib to give with conventional chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin to chronic myeloid leukaemia patients in blastic transformation phase.
