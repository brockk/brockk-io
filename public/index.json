The programme was delivered for the first time during Sep-Dec 2019, consisting of 42 hours of tuition delivered over 21 sessions by 10 members of CRCTU's Biostatistics team. Sessions were taught in computer laboratories and material was example-based so attendees devoted a lot of time to implementing what they were learning.\nA cornerstone of the programme was to teach methods for repeatable research, like using statistical software to automatically create reports and source control software to manage mission-critical code. The course also covered modern statistical approaches to common yet sometimes thorny tasks like dose-finding, sub-group analyses, Bayesian analysis, and modelling of repeated measures.\nBootcamp was primarily aimed at new recruits but statisticians with many years\u0026rsquo; experience also attended to develop their technical skills. Sessions were presented by members of the team in their particular field of expertise, creating an environment where the team educated itself. In some sessions, even the professors of biostatistics featured amongst the attendees.\nThe programme will be implemented again to train recruits in 2020, and expanded to cover further trials topics.\nMaterial Sessions are presented as learnr tutorials and packaged as an R-package called bootcamp hosted on GitHub.\nTo install the package on your computer, run\ndevtools::install_github('brockk/bootcamp')\nin R.\nRunning bootcamp tutorials Locally To run a tutorial locally, you use a command like:\nlearnr::run_tutorial('intro', package = 'bootcamp')\nYou can substitute intro above for:\n bootcamp intro folders git ggplot2 markdown rmarkdown snapshots tidyverse models repeatedmeasures subgroups stan  On RStudio Cloud You do not have to install bootcamp to use it, however.

The module is a core part of the university's new MSc in Clinical Trials. It runs over five consecutive days from 9th to 13th March 2020.\nDay One Day one is concerned with dose-finding trials. We learn about the fundamentals of dose-finding and the perennial yet underwhelming 3+3 method. We will perform hands-on analysis using R, RStudio and Shiny web apps to simulate virtual trials and observe how the 3+3 method comes unstuck. We also delve into some of the historic disasters that have occurred in dose-finding trials and look at features in the design and conduct that can ameliorate the dangers.\nDay Two Day two builds on the material from day one by introducing model-based dose-finding methods. We focus in particular on the continual reassessment method (CRM). We learn about model fitting and interpretation, and see the method in action in practical sessions. We then look at how model-based dose-finding trials are reported in journals. We finish the day by hearing testimony from a patient on a dose-finding trial at CRCTU.\nDay Three On day three we leave dose-finding behind and turn our focus to phase II trials. On this day we learn about the different approaches to phase II trials, including the suite of optimal designs with fixed sample size, like A'Hern's, Simon's two-stage, and Bryant \u0026amp; Day's designs. We conclude with an interview of a patient from the Clarity trial at CRCTU.\nDay Four On day four, we cover advanced topics at phase II. This includes the use of surrogate outcomes when it is impossible to observe the clinical outcome of primary interest in a reasonable time frame. We also look at co-primary outcomes, and the roles of biomarkers and subgroups.\nDay Five Day five is a special day devoted to Complex and Innovative Designs, a group that includes basket trials, umbrella trials, and platform trials. These designs have proliferated in cancer in recent years as we have discovered many potential driver mutations, allowing trialists to investigate therapies that target specific genetic aberrations. We study examples run by the University of Birmingham's two trials units. We then look at these designs from the point of view of a competent authority, like the MHRA, the EMA or the FDA.\nTo learn more, visit the course webpage at https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/taught/med/pg-modules/early-phase-clinical-trials.aspx.\n","date":1577491200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1579246482,"objectID":"c8e361319c51b2ed52aeb7c6cab606d9","permalink":"https://www.kristianbrock.com/courses/epct/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/epct/","section":"courses","summary":"A module of the MSc in Clinical Trials offered by the University of Birmingham, focussing on phase I and phase II clinical trials.","tags":null,"title":"Early Phase Clinical Trials","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Trial results were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine (Middleton et al. 2020). Previous trials in the KEYNOTE series (Garon et al. 2015; Herbst et al. 2016) had showed that pembrolizumab was efficacious in NSCLC patients.\n The gap in the evidence Performance status (PS) is a variable defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group to reflect cancer patients’ general well-being and activities of daily life. It is an ordered variable with five levels reflecting greater levels of disability:\n 0 – patients are asymptomatic; 1 – patients are symptomatic but completely ambulatory; 2 – patients are symptomatic, spending up to 50% of day time in bed; 3 – patients are symptomatic, spending at least 50% of day time in bed; 4 – patients are bedbound.  We will say that a patient with a peformance status of 2 is PS2.\nThe KEYNOTE-001 trial (Garon et al. 2015) showed that pembrolizumab was efficacious in NSCLC patients. The subsequent KEYNOTE-010 trial (Herbst et al. 2016) showed that pembrolizumab was superior to docetaxel chemotherapy. However, it is doubtful that a PS2 patient would be strong enough to tolerate chemotherapy. Hence, to maintain equipoise in KEYNOTE-010, the trialists restricted randomisation to PS0 and PS1 patients. That trial was successful and pembrolizumab was licenced in NSCLC. However, as is typical, the treatment was licenced in the patient population that had been investigated in the trial. This covered just the PS0 and PS1 patients and crucially excluded PS2 patients. The KEYNOTE trials had showed that pembrolizumab was tolerable, particularly compared to the harsh chemotherapy alternatives. It is precisely in the PS2 population where a relatively tolerable but effective treatment was sorely needed. However, by virtue of their probable unsuitablility to chemotherapy, PS2 patients had been excluded from a promising new treatment.\nThe PePS2 trial sought to address this gap in the evidence.\nStratification In the KEYNOTE-001 trial, Garon et al. (2015) had introduced the programmed death ligand 1 tumour proportion score biomarker (PD-L1 TPS, or simply TPS), being the percentage of cells in a tumour biopsy that expressed PD-L1. Pembrolizumab is a PD-L1 blockade drug so it was reasonably hypothesised that the treatment would work best in those patients whose tumours expressed lots of PD-L1. The KEYNOTE-001 showed this to be precisely the case.\nKEYNOTE-001 also showed that first-line patients (those patients who had received no previous anti-cancer therapy) achieved outcomes that appeared to be slightly different to patients receiving pembrolizumab as a subsequent-line therapy.\nIn PePS2, we sought to evaluate the effects of pembrolizumab on co-primary efficacy and toxicity outcomes whilst stratifying the analysis for these baseline covariates. I developed a statistical design for this purpose, described here (Brock et al. 2019).\n Results On 19-March-2020, the results were published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

It is run by the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit.\nPePS2 is an important trial to me because I developed the analysis model as part of my PhD thesis and worked on the trial from almost the very beginning. I published a trial design paper and am glad to say that the trial results are currently under peer review. The investigators and I hope this trial will provide much-needed and much-sought evidence on the merits of giving this PD-L1 blockade drug to PS2 NSCLC patients\nDesign I became involved in PePS2 shortly after joining the trials unit in 2014. The trial called for a design that evaluated co-primary response and toxicity outcomes. Naturally, this suggests a Bryant \u0026amp; Day optimal design. However, published data in performance status 0 \u0026amp; 1 NSCLC patients showed that the PD-L1 tumour proportion score biomarker was strongly predictive of response. There was also evidence that first-line patients did better than subsequent-line patients. We expected each of these variables to remain predictive in the performance status 2 population and wanted to stratify the analysis by these variables. Unfortunately, Bryant \u0026amp; Day's design assumes an homogeneous population so does not admit explanatory variables.\nI happened to be working on a dose-finding trial at the time that used the EffTox design of Thall \u0026amp; Cook (2004) to appraise joint efficacy and toxicity rates at different doses of experimental agents. It struck me on a cycle home that the EffTox design could be adjusted with variables reflecting PD-L1 and line-of-therapy status in place of dose to study our co-primary outcomes whilst adjusting for our putative predictive factors. I worked up the design as part of my PhD, eventually published a design paper, and used the model to conduct a Bayesian analysis of the trial outcomes.\nResults The results for PePS2 were published in March 2020 in Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

To use the language of tidyverse R, escalation provides a grammar for dose-finding by breaking the dose-finding process into chunks. What model should I use? How should I select dose during the trial? How will I know when to stop? Which restrictions should I place on escalation and de-escalation? You can create the dose-finding design you want in escalation by combining elements that perform all of these tasks. This might all sound a little obtuse. Some examples will make it clear.\nExamples CRM O’Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990) introduced the classic continual reassessment method (CRM) and it has been implemented in many software packages since. One of the most popular R implementations is the dfcrm package by Cheung (2013). Let’s fit a model using dfcrm.\nThe very least information we need to provide is a dose-toxicity skeleton, and our target toxicity level:\nskeleton \u0026lt;- c(0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.6) target \u0026lt;- 0.25 We use these to create a model-fitting object:\nlibrary(escalation) model \u0026lt;- get_dfcrm(skeleton = skeleton, target = target) The model can then be fit to outcomes. The escalation package uses the outcome syntax introduced for phase I trials in Brock (2019) and for seamless phase I/II trials in Brock et al. (2017). Let’s assume we have treated 3 patients at dose-level 2 and none of them experienced toxicity. We represent this using the outcome string 2NNN. Fitting the model to the set of outcomes invokes the dose-selection algorithm:\nfit \u0026lt;- model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;2NNN\u0026#39;) and the fit object will tell you the dose recommended by the CRM model to be administered next:\nfit %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 4 The model advocates skipping straight from dose 2 to dose 4. Clinicians are unlikely to feel comfortable with this. We can respecify the model to expressly not skip doses in escalation:\nmodel \u0026lt;- get_dfcrm(skeleton = skeleton, target = target) %\u0026gt;% dont_skip_doses(when_escalating = TRUE) We have taken the original dfcrm model and added an extra module to prevent skipping doses in escalation. Refitting the new model to the same outcomes gives:\nfit \u0026lt;- model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;2NNN\u0026#39;) fit %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 3 We see that the ensemble now decides to select dose 3. We can ask the trial design whether it wants to keep recruting patients:\nfit %\u0026gt;% continue() ## [1] TRUE Naturally it wants to continue because dfcrm does not implement any stopping rules. However, we can easily add some. Let us say that we want to stop once the model has evaluated 18 patients, or at least 9 at the dose being recommended, whichever occurs first. We specify this model by adding more behaviours:\nmodel \u0026lt;- get_dfcrm(skeleton = skeleton, target = target) %\u0026gt;% dont_skip_doses(when_escalating = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% stop_at_n(n = 18) %\u0026gt;% stop_when_n_at_dose(dose = \u0026#39;recommended\u0026#39;, n = 9) Let’s fit this model to some more patients to see how this trial plays out:\nfit \u0026lt;- model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;2NNN 3TTN\u0026#39;) fit %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 2 fit %\u0026gt;% continue() ## [1] TRUE After seeing two-in-three patients in the second cohort experience toxicity at dose 3, the design understandably wants to de-escalate. Let’s do that:\nfit \u0026lt;- model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;2NNN 3TTN 2TNN\u0026#39;) fit %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 2 fit %\u0026gt;% continue() ## [1] TRUE The third cohort yielded one-in-three tox at dose 2. The design wants to continue at dose 2 so let’s do that:\nfit \u0026lt;- model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;2NNN 3TTN 2TNN 2NNT\u0026#39;) fit %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 2 fit %\u0026gt;% continue() ## [1] FALSE Notice that the call to continue() now returns FALSE. The design wants to stop now and recommend dose 2. It does this because it has seen 9 patients at the recommended dose. We can see the number of patients treated at each of the five doses under investigation:\nfit %\u0026gt;% n_at_dose() ## [1] 0 9 3 0 0 Our stopping criteria have been met. We can verify that dose 2 is indeed the dose with posterior expected toxicity rate closest to our target of 25%:\nfit %\u0026gt;% mean_prob_tox() ## [1] 0.1845713 0.2728713 0.4575229 0.5964102 0.7496662  BOIN escalate also implements the BOIN dose-finding design by Liu and Yuan (2015) via the BOIN R-package (Yuan and Liu 2018).\nIn contrast to CRM, BOIN does not require a dose-toxicity skeleton. In its simplest case, it requires merely the number of doses under investigation and our target toxicity level:\ntarget \u0026lt;- 0.25 model \u0026lt;- get_boin(num_doses = 5, target = target) As before, we can fit the model to some observed outcomes:\nfit \u0026lt;- model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;2NNN\u0026#39;) fit %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 3 fit %\u0026gt;% continue() ## [1] TRUE The BOIN dose selector natively implements stopping rules, as described by Liu \u0026amp; Yuan. For instance, if the bottom dose is too toxic, the design will advise the trial halts:\nfit \u0026lt;- model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;2NTN 1TTT\u0026#39;) fit %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] NA fit %\u0026gt;% continue() ## [1] FALSE Nevertheless, as with the CRM examples above, our BOIN selector can be adorned with various behaviours to tailor stopping and skipping. In fact, we can add the exact same behaviours as before because all escalation objects support exactly the same interface. This makes the package completely modular. We are building the design we want from pieces of Lego:\nmodel \u0026lt;- get_boin(num_doses = 5, target = target) %\u0026gt;% dont_skip_doses(when_escalating = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% stop_at_n(n = 18) %\u0026gt;% stop_when_n_at_dose(dose = \u0026#39;recommended\u0026#39;, n = 9) fit \u0026lt;- model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;2NNN 3TTN 2TNN 2NNT\u0026#39;) fit %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 2 fit %\u0026gt;% continue() ## [1] FALSE fit %\u0026gt;% mean_prob_tox() ## [1] NA 0.23 0.66 NA NA Notice that the posterior toxicity estimate is similar to the CRM model at dose 2, but ultimately different because the two approaches use different model forms. BOIN does not estimate the tox rate at doses that have not been administered.\n Initial escalation plans Another dose-selection mechanism supported by escalation is the concept of an initial escalation plan. These can be used at the start of a trial to show how escalation should proceed initially. As soon as the realised outcomes diverge from the prespecified path, or the path reaches the end, a secondary model takes over.\nFor instance, let us assume we would like to treat one patient per dose so long as no toxicity is seen, in order to facilitate fast escalation. When toxicity is seen, or dose five is reached, we would like to hand control to a CRM model. We can write:\nmodel \u0026lt;- follow_path(\u0026#39;1N 2N 3N 4N 5N\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% get_dfcrm(skeleton = skeleton, target = target) So long as the idealised path is realised, it continues:\nmodel %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;1N\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 2 model %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;1N 2N\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 3 But if the path is deviated from, the secondary model takes over:\nmodel %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;1N 2N 3T\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 2 Also, when the initial path is completed, the secondary model continues:\nmodel %\u0026gt;% fit(\u0026#39;1N 2N 3N 4N 5N\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% recommended_dose() ## [1] 5   Summary The escalation package takes dose-finding methods that other authors have provided and gives them a consistent interface. This makes it simple to add any behaviour to any method, creating a modular Lego-like approach to creating dose-finding designs. For instance, we can take any dose-selection model and tweak the way it selects the next dose, the way it escalates, de-escalates and stops. I hope eventually that escalation makes it easy to specify, assess and compare all dose-escalation designs.\n Roadmap Version 0.0.1 has been submitted to CRAN (but as of 2020-02-17, not yet accepted) with the following base dose-finding approaches:\n the CRM model from the dfcrm package the BOIN model from the BOIN package the perennial 3+3 model without dose de-escalation  and the following optional embellishments:\n don’t skip doses in escalation and/or de-escalation stop when dose(s) are too toxic stop when \\(n\\) patients have been treated in total stop when \\(n\\) patients have been treated at a particular dose use an initial fixed dose-escalation plan demand at least \\(n\\) patients have been treated at a particular dose before stopping is permitted.  In future versions, the following base dose-finding approaches will probably be added:\n the EWOC model from the EWOC package the CRM and EffTox models from the trialr package the CRM model from the bcrm package the CRM model from the crmPack package  Before I plough into the MCMC methods (trialr, bcrm, crmPack), I want to understand the implications of adding other software to the dependency chain to what at the moment is a very lightweight package.\nIn addition to those, I plan to add further behaviours that allow:\n stopping under the conditions investigated by Zohar and Chevret (2001); selecting dose by the CIBP criterion of Mozgunov and Jaki (2020).  Independent to the work described above, I will add functions that run simulations and calculate dose pathways.\n How escalation came about It had bothered me for several years that it always seemed so difficult to tweak behaviour of dose-finging designs to allow flexible stopping (etc). In my trials unit, we frequently started with the dfcrm code and then added custom embellishments to achieve the design and behaviour we wanted in each particular trial. Running simulations or calculating future dose pathways was never as simple as it should have been. The approach we used of tweaking dfcrm implicitly assumed we needed a more complex dose-fitting function. And then one night at about 4am when I was neither asleep nor awake, I realised that we needed to daisy-chain the dose-selecting classes together to augment behaviour. We did not need a more complex dose-fitting function, we needed a flexible way of combining simple functions. Having used dplyr and tidyverse packages for years now, the %\u0026gt;% operator seemed the natural solution.\n Installation # Once it hits CRAN, install the latest official version with: install.packages(\u0026quot;escalation\u0026quot;) # Alternatively, install the latest code at any time from GitHub: devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;brockk/escalation\u0026quot;)  Resources  GitHub repo Documentation   References Brock, Kristian. 2019. “trialr: Bayesian Clinical Trial Designs in R and Stan.” arXiv E-Prints, June, arXiv:1907.00161.\n Brock, Kristian, Lucinda Billingham, Mhairi Copland, Shamyla Siddique, Mirjana Sirovica, and Christina Yap. 2017. “Implementing the EffTox Dose-Finding Design in the Matchpoint Trial.” BMC Medical Research Methodology 17 (1): 112. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-017-0381-x.\n Cheung, Ken. 2013.

Being able to visualise data and communicate technical details to others quickly and effectively is important. Being able to reproduce something you calculated last month is necessary. R Markdown addresses both of these problems by interweaving prose and code to produce rich, interactive documents in … whatever format you need.\nHere is RStudio explaining better than I could:\n   R Markdown is super flexible. Some things I have created in it are:\n A complete journal article, including abstract, authors and affiliations, keywords, figures and tables with captions, cross-referencing, bibliography (link to source) Literally this exact webpage you are reading right now (link to source) Interactive tutorials at https://rstudio.cloud/project/454702. Look for the Run.R file to launch a tutorial. (link to source)  In each example, the source code is written 100% in R Markdown and then compiled to create the article PDF or the web page or the Word doc or whatever. To emphasise that point, I have provided a link to the source Rmd file in each instance.\nThe R users at CRCTU use R Markdown files to conduct trial analyses and produce DMC reports. We trained new statisticians in this area because we knew that it is not the kind of thing universities would teach in their MSc programmes. However, reproducible research is one of the core pillars of our bootcamp programme and we see R Markdown as the key technology in this area.\nDo you train statisticians in this area at your institution? Do you want to? Are you a statistician that wishes they had access to this type of training?

I found I would frequently get the designs mixed up:\n \u0026ldquo;We are targeting 20% toxicity in this trial, right? No, that was the other trial\u0026hellip;we are targeting 33% here\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n Similarly, once or twice, I got to the stage where I wanted to run simulations only to discover we had not specified some important design aspect, like when the trial should stop. To bring all the pertinent information to the fore, I wrote a checklist. I would take the list and fill it out for each trial to ensure I had all the right information before I started simulating.\nDownload the checklist as PDF, editable Word version, or completed example.\nChecklist 1. Doses under investigation? Put simply, which doses are you investigating? And how many are there? Let's refer to the number of doses as $n$. For the plain vanilla CRM, the doses should be fully orderable, meaning it should be possible to unambiguously state that $a \u0026gt; b$ or $a \u0026lt; b$ for each pair of doses $a, b$. Incidentally, this is also true of the 3+3. It is easy to inadvertently violate the total orderability rule when you have combinations (e.g. is 10mg A + 10mb B a greater or lesser dose than 5mg A + 20mg B?) or when you are varying doses and frequencies (e.g. is 20mg of A each day a greater or lesser dose than 100mg of A once per week?).\n2. Target toxicity level? What probability of dose-limiting toxicity are you targeting? CRM and 3+3 are toxicity-chasing designs - they will escalate dose until toxicity is seen. There must be a rationale for why escalation is anticipated to be beneficial to the patient. So what probability of toxicity are you targeting? If it is hard to specify an acceptable target, or the target is very low, that might be a sign that CRM and 3+3 are not suitable approaches.\n3. Skeleton? What is your a-priori expectation of the rate of toxicity at each dose? This should be a monotonically-increasing vector of probabilities of length $n$.\n4. Starting dose? Which dose will you start at? Having a dose or two to de-escalate to might be preferable in case your toxicity expectations are wrong.\n5. Model type? There have been various suggestions to model the dose-toxicity curve. Will you use the empiric approach, or a one parameter logisitic approach, etc?\n6. Model parameters? Different model types require different parameters and hyperparameters. E.g. the empiric model shifts the skeleton up and down as DLT outcomes are evaluated in patients, using a single parameter, often called $\\beta$. That parameter needs a prior distribution. The default prior on $\\beta$ in dfcrm is $\\beta \\sim N(0, 1.34)$. I will let you research why.\n7. How to select dose? Will you select the dose with estimated DLT probability closest to the target? Or closest to target without exceeding the target? Will you permit skipping doses in escalation? How about de-escalation?\n8. When to stop? Trials end1 - when will your trial end? What is the maximum sample size? Do you have a stopping rule for excess toxicity? Do you want to evaluate a minimum number of patients at the candidate dose before you stop? Also, check that these constraints do not contradict one another!\n9. Length of DLT assessment window? How long is the DLT assessment window?\nIf using non-time-to-event method: 10. How to select cohort size? Commonly, designs have used fixed cohort sizes of three. But perhaps you want to use flexible cohort sizes of 2-5 patients, depending on the times at which the patients arrive? How will you simulate this?\nIf using time-to-event method: 11. How to calculate weight of observation? Under the Time-to-Event CRM (TITE-CRM), censored observations of non-DLT are weighted somewhere between 0 and 1. Logically, the weight should be a non-decreasing function of the length of follow-up. If DLT is experienced, the weight should be 1. Several weight functions have been proposed. A simple option is linear, i.e. 50% of the evaluation period without DLT is considered to be 0.5 non-DLT events.\nFor simulation: 12. What is assumed true Prob(DLT)? The key simulation parameter, what is the true probability of DLT at each dose? It will be tempting to choose a true dose-DLT curve that looks similar to your skeleton but do not stop there. Naturally, a thorough simulation study will look at many true dose-DLT curves, with the sought dose appearing at different positions. If you have a rule for early stopping, you might want to consider a scenario where the true DLT probabilities are all too high.\nFor simulation using time-to-event method: 13. What is time between patient arrivals? When simulating using the TITE-CRM method, you will need to randomly sample patient arrival times. For memoryless waiting times, the exponential distribution would do the job.\n14. What is time between patient arrivals? Generally in simulation, you sample whether toxicity will happen in a patient given their assigned dose and the associated probability of DLT using a random draw from a Bernoulli distribution. Once you have established that toxicity occurs in a given patient, you will need to sample the time of the DLT. How will you do that? You might assume a constant hazard, for example, and thus use an exponential distribution. Obviously, if a patient does not experience DLT then their DLT time is infinite.\nAvailability of software Having made all these choices (and it is exhausting to even think of all these things), you then have to find or write code to make it happen. You may find you do not have the time or programming skill to write exactly what you want and opt for an off-the-shelf solution. Each of dfcrm, bcrm, and crmPack offer methods for simulating CRM trials, and my very own trialr will have CRM simulation methods soon. However, each differs in what they offer (that feels like a blog post for another day). You may discover that no off-the-shelf package does exactly what you want and find yourself tweaking your choices above in light of what is feasible. It is an iterative process.\nRead more Graham Wheeler and co-authors 2 wrote a tutorial for designing dose-finding trials using the CRM.
