Do we expect the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity to increase as dose increases in dose-escalation clinical trials? 
Categorically, yes. 

Do we expect efficacy to be greater at higher doses?
Implicitly yes - it is a reqirement of MTD-seeking methods like 3+3 and CRM.

But how well are each of these assumptions borne out by the data in real clinical trials?
These questions motivated us to collect dose-level outcomes from recent dose-escalation clinical trials in cancer.

The dataset is introduced in [this post](/post/dose-finding-data/).
Analyses of the data will be conducted in future posts.
