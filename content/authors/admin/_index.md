I am a biostatistician specialising in Bayesian trial methodology at AstraZeneca. 
I have experience in cancer and non-cancer clinical trials. 
I have authored several methodology papers and conducted the analysis for several trial results publications. 
I write statistical software.
By honourary association, I supervise trial methods research at the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit at the University of Birmingham.
