I am a biostatistician specialising in Bayesian and early-phase trial methodology at UCB. 
I have experience in cancer and non-cancer clinical trials. 
I have authored several methodology papers and conducted the analysis for several trial results publications. 
By honourary association, I lead a MSc module on early phase trials at the University of Birmingham and supervise PhDs on trial methodology.
